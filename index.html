  <h1>Otis P. Wilbursnoot &bull; Puppy-at-Large</h1>
  <hr>  
  <p>Mr. Wilbursnoot, affectionally known as Oatmeal, Odie, Otis, or Oats to his family, entered the heart and home of his owner, Brooke.  He was adopted to be a loyal companion to Molly the Shih-Tzu.  Ultimately, he became not only her best buddy but also a friend to every person and canine he met.  His days were filled with squirrels, walks, peanut butter, and basking lazily in the sun.</p>
