    <p>Mr. Wilbursnoot, affectionally known as Oatmeal, Odie, Otis, or Oats to his family, entered the heart and home of his owner, Brooke.  He was adopted to be a loyal companion to Molly the Shih-tzu.  Ultimately, he became not only her best buddy but also a friend to every person and canine he met.  His days were filled with squirrels, walks, peanut butter, and basking lazily in the sun.</p>
    <h2>The Early Years</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Oatmeal hailed from Canon City, Colorado under the given name Kermit.  Although his natural parents and siblings are unknown, his history shows he was a puppy-at-large.  He was but a lonely pup on city streets, living a life of straydom.  The day came when the local animal control took Oatmeal into custody, booked him into a dog pound, which, partnered with the Cotopaxi Poodle Preserve, posted his picture online.  This picture captured Odie's happy nature and sweet temperatment, which ultimately captured my heart.  Within a week, his adoption fee was paid and he was joyfully running through the yard with Shih-tzu Molly and me.</p>
